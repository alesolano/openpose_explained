# OpenPose Explained

_This work would be impossible without_ [_Ildoo Kim_](https://github.com/ildoonet/tf-pose-estimation).

Material regarding my talks at EuroSciPy 2018 and PyConES 2018.

There are 4 notebooks:
* 3 notebooks start 3 different ROS nodes: 1 that reads frames from your webcam, 1 that process those frames using OpenPose and 1 that displays the output image in a window.
* 1 notebook allows you to compare the different versions of OpenPose (which I've called VGG and Mobile). One of them uses standard convolutions while the other depthwise convolutions.

## Set up

(0) Install Docker.

(1) Build the image.

`$ sudo docker build openpose_ros .`

(2) Run a container.

```
sudo docker run --rm -it \
   --ipc=host -p 8888:8888 \
   --device=/dev/video0:/dev/video0 \
   --env="DISPLAY" \
   --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
   --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
   openpose_ros bash
```

(3) Run `roscore` on background.

`$ roscore &`

Once `roscore` is all set (this will take a few seconds), Ctrl+C to return to the command line while `roscore` still runs on background.

(4) Run Jupyter.

`$ jupyter-notebook --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser --allow-root`

Now you can go to your browser and access the notebook through `http://localhost:8888/?token=HERECOMESYOURTOKEN`.  
**Important**: modify the last address adding the token generated by Jupyter at start.

(5) Needed to see in your screen the windows generated in the docker container.

`$ xhost +local:root`
